# What is dEbuild?

dEbuild is a simple shell script that aims to simplify the process of adding dependencies to your custom ebuild file


# How does it work?

simply clone the repo and make the script executable

``` shell
git clone https://github.com/TomRomeo/dEbuild
cd dEbuild
chmod +x ./dEbuild.sh
```

after that, start the script and follow the instructions. It will then create a basic ebuild file containing all the
necessary dependencies
